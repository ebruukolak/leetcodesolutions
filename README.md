# LeetCode Solutions by Ebru

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! This is where I document my journey of solving LeetCode problems. My goal is to consistently solve at least two problems per week and share my solutions here. This repository serves as a personal record of my progress and a resource for others who are also practicing algorithmic problem-solving.

## About
This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. Each solution is written in C#, and I strive to provide clear explanations and optimizations where possible.

## Goals
- Solve at least **two LeetCode problems per week**.
- Document my thought process and approach for each problem.
- Improve my problem-solving skills and understanding of data structures and algorithms.
- Share my solutions to help others learn and grow.

## Structure of the Repository
The repository is organized as follows:

/LeetCodeSolutions/
├── Easy/ # Solutions to easy-level problems
├── Medium/ # Solutions to medium-level problems
├── Hard/ # Solutions to hard-level problems
├── README.md # This file

Each problem solution is stored in its respective difficulty folder, with the file name following the format:  
`[problem_number]_[problemName].[file_extension]`  
For example: `1_TwoSum.cs`

## How to Use
1. Navigate to the folder corresponding to the problem difficulty (easy, medium, or hard).
2. Find the problem you're interested in by its number and name.
3. Open the file to view the solution and explanation.
